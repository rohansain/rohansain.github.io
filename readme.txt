Rock Paper Scissors Game Description This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, designed to solidify my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to provide an interactive and engaging experience where users can play against the computer, and the game keeps track of the scores.

Features Interactive Gameplay: Users can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking on the respective icons. Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the user's and the computer's scores. Dynamic Messaging: Informative messages are displayed to indicate the outcome of each round (win, lose, or draw). Responsive Design: The game layout is designed to be responsive and visually appealing on different screen sizes.

Technologies Used 1.HTML: For structuring the web page and game elements. 2.CSS: For styling the game, including the layout, icons, and dynamic message display. 3.JavaScript: For implementing the game logic, handling user interactions, and updating the scores and messages dynamically.

How to Play Open the game in a web browser. Click on one of the choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will randomly choose its move. The result of the round (win, lose, or draw) will be displayed along with updated scores. Continue playing and see if you can beat the computer!

Code Structure index.html: The main HTML file that structures the web page. style.css: The CSS file that styles the game. app.js: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and handles user interactions
